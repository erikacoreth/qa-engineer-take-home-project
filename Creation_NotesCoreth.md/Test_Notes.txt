# QA Engineer Take-Home – Cypress Tests

## UI Test Coverage
| Feature | Test File | Status | Description |
|----------|------------|--------|--------------|
| Add Customer | `addCustomer.cy.ts` |  Passed | Fills the form and verifies new row appears |
| Edit Customer | `editCustomer.cy.ts` |  Passed | Finds row by last name and updates a field |
| View Customer | `viewCustomer.cy.ts` |  Skipped | Placeholder for viewing customer modal (pending feature) |
| Delete Customer | `deleteCustomer.cy.ts` |  Skipped | Placeholder for delete flow (pending feature) |

##  Notes
- Cypress tests written in TypeScript (`.cy.ts`).
- Used `cy.contains()`, `.parents('tr')`, and `.within()` for scoped DOM targeting.
- Added `{ force: true }` for modal elements that load behind overlays.
- Pending features (View/Delete) marked with `it.skip()` per README instructions.
- Tested locally via `npm run dev` + `npx cypress open`.
